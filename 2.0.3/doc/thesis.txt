Over some time with using momgen, I have noticed
some more annoying things with its output, which
includes:

* A DDIR variable not being generated with
  single file Makefiles set up with
  distribution rules
* Spacing issues with the initial distribution
  rule

This is a relatively short update, which only
necessitates the version number incrementing by
one. I will try to fix these as soon as I can.

The above is subject to change.
