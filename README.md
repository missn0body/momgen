# momk

A stripped-down, simplistic GNU Makefile generator. Created in 2024 by anson.

This program is a unique one, in that I made it first and foremost for myself.
It cuts so many corners that it might as well be a circle, but because I am lazy
and I didn't want to copy Makefiles from other projects and keep replacing names,
so I decided to make a generator. As such, it is fitted for my workflow. There is
enough functionality that someone can reasonably use it for themselves, though their
projects may start to, or may already look like mine.

Essentially, don't expect too much out of this program. Use `-h` or `--help` to see
commands on how to customize your Makefile. This generator can generate C or C++ Makefiles.
