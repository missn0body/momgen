I have become aware that there are some bugs
within the 2.0.0 version of momgen within a few
hours of using it for myself. Fair enough, so I will
issue a new version with a new fix for now.

There are issues with:
* Missing BIN variable
* CCFLAGS instead of CFLAGS
* CCFLAGS should be CXXFLAGS
* BDIR/BIN should change to BIN when making single-file distributions
* A check needs to be made for a doc/ directory when making dist. rules
* No .PHONY rule

I will try to fix these as soon as I can.

The above is subject to change.
